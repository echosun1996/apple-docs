# 处理用户输入-HandlingUserInput

在地标APP中，用户可以标记他们喜欢的地方，

> In the Landmarks app, a user can flag their favorite places, and filter the list to show just their favorites. To create this feature, you’ll start by adding a switch to the list so users can focus on just their favorites, and then you’ll add a star-shaped button that a user taps to flag a landmark as a favorite.
